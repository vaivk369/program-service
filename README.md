# Installing Contribution/Program Service on Local Laptop or Desktop

## Pre-requisites

Before you install program service on your laptop, examine your environment and gather data to ensure an optimal installation experience. Review the [details](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-Mi9QwJlsfb7xuxTBc0J/s/SjljYc0PyD64vGgDlMl4/use/system-requirements) to ensure that the environment has the necessary resources and compliant target systems to successfully install and run Program Service.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the project
    - Fork the [main source code repository](https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/program-service)
    - Clone the forked repository and add main source code repository as upstream

    ```console
        git clone {SSH URL of FORKED REPOSITORY}
        cd {PROJECT-FOLDER}
        git remote add upstream git@github.com:Sunbird-Ed/program-service.git
        git fetch upstream
        git checkout -b {LOCAL-BRANCH-NAME} upstream/{LATEST BRANCH}
    ```
    > ***Note***: Stable versions of the program service are available via tags for each release, and the master branch contains latest stable release. For latest stable release [refer](https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/program-service/branches)

2. Install Git Submodules to make use of https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-js-utils.git

    ```console
        cd {PROJECT-FOLDER}
        git submodule init
        git submodule update
    ```
3. Install required dependencies

    ```console
        cd {PROJECT-FOLDER}/src
        npm install
    ```

4. Configuring the Environment
   - Open the file `{PROJECT-FOLDER}/src/envVariables.js` in any available text editor and update the contents of the file so that it contains exactly the following values

    ```console
    const envVariables = {
    baseURL: process.env.dock_base_url || <'https://<host for adopter's instance'>,
    SUNBIRD_URL: process.env.sunbird_base_url || <'https://<host for adopter's instance'>,
    ....
    config: {
        user: process.env.sunbird_program_db_user || "<postgress user>",
        host: process.env.sunbird_program_db_host || "localhost",
        database: process.env.sunbird_program_db_name || 'sunbird_programs',
        password: process.env.sunbird_program_db_password || '<postgress password>',
       ....
    },
    }
    ```

    > Once the file is updated with appropriate values, then you can proceed with running the application

### Running Application

1. Run the following command in the **{PROJECT-FOLDER}/src** folder

```console
    node app.js
```

2. The local HTTP server is launched at `http://localhost:6000`

> Note: To create Postgres table in the local db use the `<project-folder>/programs.sql`
